# Create Composites

# Q1: Descrptively, which group has a higher self-esteem? What about life satisfaction? Is the relationship between self-esteem and life satisfaction stronger for males or for females?

Males appear to have higher self-esteem. Females appear to have higher
life satisfaction. The relationship between self esteem and life
satisfaction appears to be stronger for Males.

# Visualization of Data Distribution

``` r
lab3data<- lab3data %>%
  drop_na(Gender)


ggplot(lab3data, aes(x = Gender, y = RSE)) + geom_violin(aes(fill=Gender)) + scale_fill_simpsons() + theme_modern()
```

#Create a plot for SWL by Gender with a different color palette

# Q2: What you can tell from looking at a violin plot? What you cannot tell? What inferences you can make based on the two violin plots?

A violin plot itself can show us: - Distribution of scores; - Mode (ie
in this case, most responders, both male and female in SWE fall at 4/5
for life satisfaction) - Total possible Range of scores (ie 0-25 here)

A violin plot itself cannot show us: - Mean - Median - Standard
Deviation - Standard Error - Total number of scores from each subject -
Total number of surveyed subjects - correlation (separate plots)

We can infer from this violin plot: We see that Male and Female
distribution appears to be quite visually similar in terms of life
satisfaction, however, there are a couple subtle visual cues; more
female than male subjects fall at 10/25 and 15/25for total life
satisfaction score, whereas more males appear to land at 20/25. Also, it
appears that slightly more male respondents fall at the 5/25 total score
than females. Could it be that Males are more likely to fall in the
extremes of satisfaction, whereas Females are more likely to be middle
of the road?

In terms of self esteem, again they do appear to have visually similar
distributions, with some slight differences; visual cues for difference
show a more triangular distribution for Males, whereas Females show a
more spherical distribution. There appear to be two modes for Male
subjects at 3 and at 4 (or slightly below 4) whereas the smoother
distribution for Female subjects does not indicate two modes; it appears
that the Female mode lands around 3, but no strong peaks or valleys.
